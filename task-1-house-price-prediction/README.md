# 🏠 House Price Prediction – Linear Regression

This project was completed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship** at **Skill Craft Technologies**. The goal was to build a basic regression model to predict house prices using features like area, number of rooms, and condition.

---

## 📌 Overview

- Used **Linear Regression** to predict house prices.
- Focused on **cleaning the dataset**, including handling **misaligned columns**.
- Performed basic **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Evaluated the model using **R² score**.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- **R² Score**: `0.83`

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

This was a learning-focused task that helped me improve my skills in data cleaning, especially in handling **misaligned columns**, and understanding how simple models like **Linear Regression** can still be effective.
